## Branch and Worktree Policy

Unless the user explicitly requests otherwise, make changes directly on the
`main` branch in the current workspace. Do not create a separate branch or
worktree by default.

<!-- HARNESS:BEGIN -->
## Harness

This repo uses Harness. Before work, read:

- `README.md`
- `docs/HARNESS.md`
- `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/CONTEXT_RULES.md`
- `scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix` on macOS/Linux, or `.\scripts\bin\harness-cli.exe query matrix` on Windows

Use the Rust Harness CLI at `scripts/bin/harness-cli` on macOS/Linux or
`scripts/bin/harness-cli.exe` on Windows as the main operational tool.
